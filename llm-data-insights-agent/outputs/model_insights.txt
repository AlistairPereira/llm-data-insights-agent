Here are the answers:

• **Dataset and Target Summary**: The dataset contains information about 205 cars, including their features such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, make, and price. The chosen target column for prediction is "price", which indicates that this is a regression problem where we want to predict the price of a car based on its features.

• **Problem Type**: This is a regression problem because the target variable (price) is continuous and there is no clear categorization or classification into distinct classes. The goal is to predict a numerical value (price).

• **Model Performance Metrics Interpretation**:
	+ RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the average distance between predicted and actual prices. A lower value indicates better performance.
	+ R2: Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. A higher value indicates better performance.
	+ These metrics suggest that the model is performing reasonably well, with an RMSE around 3191 and an R2 of 0.873.

• **Target Missing Percentage**: The target missing percentage (0%) implies that there are no missing values in the "price" column, which means all observations have a valid price value.

• **Feature Importances Interpretation**:
	+ The top feature importances suggest that engine size is the most important factor, followed by highway MPG. This makes sense because engine size and fuel efficiency can significantly impact a car's price.
	+ Other features like horsepower, width, city MPG, make, drive wheels, body style, and normalized losses are less important.

• **Next Steps to Improve the Model or Analysis**:
	1. **Handle Missing Values**: Even though there are no missing values in the "price" column, it's essential to check other columns for missing values and consider imputation techniques (e.g., mean/median imputation) if necessary.
	2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features that might be relevant for predicting car prices, such as mileage, transmission type, or fuel economy.
	3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. This could involve adjusting parameters like learning rate, batch size, or number of hidden layers in a neural network.
