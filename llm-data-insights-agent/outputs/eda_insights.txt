**Dataset Description:**

* Rows: 205
* Columns: 15
	+ Numeric columns: symboling, width, height, engine-size, city-mpg, highway-mpg, price
	+ Categorical columns: normalized-losses, make, fuel-type, body-style, drive-wheels, engine-location

**Data Quality:**

* Missing values are very low (less than 0.01% for all columns)
* No obvious data quality issues were found in the provided JSON summary

**Important Numeric Insights:**

* **Engine Size and Price Correlation:** The correlation between engine size and price is strong, indicating a possible positive relationship where larger engines are associated with higher prices.
* **Fuel Type Distribution:** Gasoline vehicles make up about 85% of the dataset (185 out of 205), while diesel vehicles account for only 10%.
* **City vs. Highway MPG Range:** City MPG values range from 13 to 49, while highway MPG values range from 16 to 54. The average city MPG is slightly lower than the average highway MPG.
* **Symboling Value Distribution:** Symboling values range from -2 to 3, with a mean of 0.834 and standard deviation of 1.245.

**Follow-up Analyses or Questions:**

* What are the most common types of engines used in these vehicles? ( engine-type column)
* How do vehicle prices vary by region or country?
* Are there any notable relationships between fuel type and other variables, such as horsepower or engine size?
