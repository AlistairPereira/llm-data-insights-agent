**Summary**

* The dataset has 205 rows and 15 columns, with key data types including integer (int64) and floating-point numbers (float64).
* The target column "price" represents the cost of each car, making this a regression problem since we're trying to predict a continuous value.

**Model Performance**

* For regression, the model achieved:
 + RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 4498.70
 + R² (Coefficient of Determination): 0.75
* These metrics indicate that the model is doing reasonably well, but there's still room for improvement.
* The RMSE value suggests that the model is not very accurate in predicting prices, with a relatively high error margin.
* The R² value indicates that about 75% of the variance in prices can be explained by the model.

**Interpretation using EDA**

* Features strongly correlated with price are:
 + Engine size
 + Highway MPG
 + Price itself (obviously!)
* Feature importances from the model show that:
 + Engine size is highly important, but less so than highway MPG
 + Other features have relatively lower importance
* Outliers in the target column "price" might affect metrics like RMSE and R². Specifically, there are 14 outliers with values above $45,000.

**Practical Insights**

* The model suggests that engine size and highway MPG are important factors affecting car prices.
* Cars with larger engines tend to be more expensive, but so do cars with better fuel efficiency (i.e., higher highway MPG).
* The high RMSE value indicates that there's a lot of variation in prices that the model can't capture.

**Next Steps**

* Feature engineering: We could try to create new features from existing ones, such as "horsepower per unit" or "fuel efficiency ratio".
* Outlier handling: Since there are outliers in the target column and key features like engine size, we might want to consider techniques like winsorization or robust regression.
* Model improvements: With better feature engineering and outlier handling, we could potentially improve the model's accuracy and reduce the RMSE value.
